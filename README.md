# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-EDA-and-MachineLearning

**Abstract**
- Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in India.
- Breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin to grow abnormally. 
- These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells and continue to gather, forming a lump or mass. 
- The cells may spread (metastasize) to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body. 
- Breast cancer mostly begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma) or in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast.

**Content**
- Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. 
- It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. 
- It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

**Problem Statement:**

 - The key challenge against its detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous). We analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning algorithms and EDA done on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.
 
**Study of Existing Systems:**
 
 1. EDA: Breast_Cancer_prediction: 
Author: A KARTHIKEYA REDDY - In this project, He did not do the analysis part and he applied only Machine Learning part.

2. Breast Cancer Detection Using ML: 
Author-MUHMMAD ALEEM RAZA - In this project, he did the analysis part and applied machine learning algorithms to predict the tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous).

**Tools/Technology used to implement proposed solution:**

● Python

● Pandas

● Numpy

● Matplotlib

● Seaborn

● Plotly

● Sklearn

● Jupyter Notebook

**Conclusion**

- Our Naive Bayes algorithm yields the highest accuracy, 94.74%. 
- Our machine learning algorithm will able to predict the tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous).
